JsonRecipes
==============

**JsonRecipes** - my version of Minecraft mod called CustomRecipes. It is for 1.7.2/1.7.10 and it uses JSON format to add recipes in the game.

Advantages of my version:

* JSON Format - easy to read and use, used everywhere else in Minecraft.
* Full NBT support. Throw any NBT tags on your items.
* OreDictionary support. Use **ANY** copper for your recipe.
* Aliases system. You can easily link back to some item(like renamed enchanted and damaged golden sword) by short and simple string. Same for fluids and recipe types(BuildCraft|Core-refinery => refinery, etc)
* Nice and easy API for modders to use.

Coming Soon:

* Some of the big mods support(Like IC2, BuildCraft, etc).
* Recipes loaded from resource packs.
* Some kind of nice JSON editor, probably in-game one.

Disadvantages:

* My version is still pretty raw, bugs can be found.
* Not everybody can properly understand how to use JSON.
